# SmartBuy Design System

## Core Principles
- **Clarity**: Information density with visual hierarchy.
- **Trust**: Consistent use of badges and status indicators.
- **Speed**: Minimalist UI for fast decision making.

## Components

### 1. Badges
- **PriceTag**: Displays currency consistently.
- **StoreBadge**: Visual indicator of the merchant.

### 2. Cards
- **ProductCard**: Main feed unit. Contains image, title, price, and signals.

### 3. Verification & Signals
- **RiskBadge**: See Anti-Cilada.
- **ReasonsBadge**: Explains why a product was recommended.

### 6. Risk Visualization (Anti-Cilada)
We use color-coded badges to communicate offer risk without blocking the user.
- **Safe (Green)**: Verified low volatility, good store.
- **Warning (Yellow)**: Be careful, some odd history.
- **Risk (Red)**: Likely a bad deal or fake promo.

All badges must have a Tooltip explaining the reason.
